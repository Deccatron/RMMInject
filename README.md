# RMMInject

**RMMInject** (Roblox Manual Map Injector) is a robust manual-mapping injection method for Roblox, developed to bypass the AMDXX64.dll patch. It provides a seamless and efficient way to inject DLLs into Roblox. **RMMInject** is open-source and written in C++.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting**

If Roblox crashes after injection, it's likely due to incorrect offsets for the following parameters:

- `SET_INSERT`
- `WHITELISTED_PAGES`
- `PAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- `kPageHash`
- `kPageMask`
- `kPageShift`
- `RBXPRINT`

These offsets are subject to change with updates, so always ensure you have the correct values.

### üìú **Current Offsets**

```cpp
constexpr uint64_t kPageHash = 0x8bae0aa10c9180a4; // This may change with updates
constexpr uint64_t kPageMask = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFF000;
constexpr uint8_t  kPageShift = 0xC;

constexpr uint64_t Offset_InsertSet = 0xdca3c0; // This may change with updates
constexpr uint64_t Offset_WhitelistedPages = 0x2a5028; // This may change with updates
constexpr uint64_t Offset_RBXPRINT = 0x1631640; // This may change with updates
```

### üîß **Setup & Usage**

1. **Compile**: Build the project in your preferred IDE or use a tool like Visual Studio.
3. **Ensure Correct Offsets**: If you encounter crashes, verify that the offsets are up to date.
