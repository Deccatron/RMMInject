# RMMInject

**RMMInject** (Roblox Manual Map Injector) is a robust manual-mapping injection method for Roblox, developed to bypass the AMDXX64.dll patch. It provides a seamless and efficient way to inject DLLs into Roblox. **RMMInject** is open-source and written in C++.

**UPDATE!**

I have fixed all issues in the old RMMInject new injector should work as advertised!

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting**

If Roblox crashes after injection, it's likely due to incorrect offsets for the following parameters:

- `SET_INSERT`
- `WHITELISTED_PAGES`
- `PAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- `kPageHash`
- `kPageMask`
- `kPageShift`
- `RBXPRINT`

These offsets are subject to change with updates, so always ensure you have the correct values.

### üìú **Current Offsets**

```cpp
//updated offsets for version-1e91b4133e334c9c!

constexpr uint64_t kPageHash = 0x84B3A57D90E73527; // Changed again due to update...
constexpr uint64_t kPageMask = 0xfffffffffffff000; // Same as before...
constexpr uint8_t  kPageShift = 0xc; // Same as before...

constexpr uint64_t Offset_InsertSet = 0xC43D00; // Changed again due to update...
constexpr uint64_t Offset_WhitelistedPages = 0x29C758; // Changed again due to update...
```

### üîß **Setup & Usage**

1. **Compile**: Build the project in your preferred IDE or use a tool like Visual Studio.
3. **Ensure Correct Offsets**: If you encounter crashes, verify that the offsets are up to date.
